But really, we take our studies to heart. We deal with *competitions*, *hackathons*, and [*action movies*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt_OgYMQFRY).\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nLike us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PupProgrammingGuild) or Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pup_progguild).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
